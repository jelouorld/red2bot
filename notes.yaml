run cron jobs on aws:
    cloudwatch + lambda: 
        favourite, simpler
    ECS scheduled tasks:
        why not. definetely a possibility 

    cloudwatch + lambda + ec2:
        cloudwatch triggers lambda which requesst_spot instances
            Bad idea unless you need server full environment for some reason
               normally, legacy code. 
    aws batch: 
        definetely possible. but this is an overkill. suitable for multistate
            highly complex pipes
