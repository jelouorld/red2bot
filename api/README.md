# OAS definition of our API


This is the contract between front-end and back-end.

This schema definition will serve for
    A) AWS API Gateway infrastructure.
        From this defintion, all infra will be spin up. 

    B) Swagger mini-server. 
        Will feed the swagger server, so we can have a "live contract" beteween back and front.
